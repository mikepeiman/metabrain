# The ultimate Operating System For Life

Stop wasting your precious time, energy and attention.
Discard distractions and overwhelm.
Capture, retrieve, plan and execute with crystalline clarity and confidence.

## Background

20+ years seeking the best knowledge-management, mindmapping, task-management, personal tracking and operational tools for living a better life.

Over a decade of notes taken, day and night, as insights and ideas arrive. 

Eleven years on the self-taught developer journey.

Countless learning projects along the way.

Here we are. 

# Your _active_ second brain

## A few fundamental principles

1. Maximize efficiency; minimize barriers to effective action
2. Attractive UI matters; make it a habitable home
3. Leverage visual intelligence for intuitive action, context, and knowledge density
4. Favor maximimum customizability and options for the user, but provide sensible defaults (will include a community marketplace for themes, widgets, processes etc)
5. Unify the environment and eliminate knowledge silos and dead/lost artifacts

# Impetus for the development of this tool

### Deficiencies of existing tools
1. Information is 
	1. fragmented across multiple apps
	2. hidden and lost within files and folders
	3. difficult to retrieve due to missing context
	4. hard to track/store/log with context due to poor UI & lack of enabling features
2. Priorities are
	1. difficult to track coherently amongst the multifarious information silos and lost notes
	2. forgotten
	3. wasting time and energy to continually recreate
3. Actions are
	1. difficult to plan due to important context being missing
	2. out of order due to priorities being misplaced
	3. wasting time and energy to continually recreate
4. Information & insights are lost due to 
	1. lack of interconnections
	2. lack of visibility
5. Time and energy are wasted due to all of the above

### Deficiencies of the human condition
1. Energy is limited
2. Time is limited
3. Attention is limited
4. Memory is fallible
5. Judgment is fallible and based on incomplete information and context

All of the above are subject to further degradation based on
1. Illness & health limitations
2. Fatigue
3. Distraction - work and life environment
4. Inherent personal characteristics - genetics, neurodivergence, trauma, injury, metabolism

# Final thoughts

The conception of Metabrain is rooted in my challenges like handling a vast number of projects, combating brain fog, the desire for efficient planning, and tackling the anxiety of undefined task durations.

This is not just an app; it's a solution emanating from my personal experiences and struggles. The vision of Metabrain is a direct reflection of my principles, needs, and desires for efficiency and comprehensive planning.
